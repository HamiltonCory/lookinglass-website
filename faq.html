            <h2 id="pricing-billing"><span role="img" aria-label="money bag">ðŸ’°</span> Pricing & Billing</h2>
            
            <h3 id="pay-as-you-go">Why pay-as-you-go instead of subscriptions?</h3>
            <p>We built Lookinglass to fight subscription fatigue. Instead of paying $20â€“$200/month whether you use AI or not, you only pay for the messages you send. <a href="/pricing">See our transparent cost breakdown</a>.</p>
            
            <h3 id="typical-cost">How much does it typically cost to use?</h3>
            <p>Costs vary by model and message length, but here are some examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple questions (gpt-4o-mini):</strong> $0.001-0.01 per message</li>
                <li><strong>Complex reasoning (o3):</strong> $0.01-0.10 per message</li>
                <li><strong>Premium reasoning (o3-pro):</strong> $0.05-0.50 for complex tasks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The app shows you the maximum cost before sending each message, so there are never surprises.</p>
            
            <h3 id="wallet-funds">What happens to my wallet funds?</h3>
            <p>Wallet funds are <strong>non-refundable</strong> but <strong>never expire</strong>. You can use them anytime, with no monthly fees or account maintenance charges. Whether you top up $1 or $100, the balance stays available until you need it.</p>
            
            <h3 id="free-credits">Do you offer any free credits for new users?</h3>
            <p>Yes! We're confident you'll love Lookinglass, so all new users who sign in with Apple receive <strong>$1 in welcome credit</strong> to explore the app and try different models risk-free. It's our way of letting you experience the transparency and control that sets Lookinglass apartâ€”no payment required to get started.</p>
            
            <h3 id="why-pay">Why would I pay when ChatGPT is free?</h3>
            <p>You probably shouldn'tâ€”if free ChatGPT's limitations work for you. <a href="https://chatgpt.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See ChatGPT's pricing tiers</a>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>ChatGPT Free tier gives you:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>10 messages every 5 hours</strong> with gpt-5</li>
                <li><strong>1 gpt-5 Thinking message per day</strong></li>
                <li><strong>16K context window</strong> (about 12,000 words)</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic downgrades:</strong> After limits, switches to "mini version" without notification</li>
                <li><strong>No visibility:</strong> Can't see which model you're using or how much capacity remains</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) gives you:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>160 messages every 3 hours</strong> with gpt-5</li>
                <li><strong>3,000 gpt-5 Thinking messages per week</strong></li>
                <li><strong>32K context window</strong> (about 24,000 words)</li>
                <li><strong>Model selection:</strong> Can manually choose models</li>
                <li><strong>No pro models:</strong> No access to gpt-5-pro, o3-pro, or o1-pro</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>ChatGPT Pro ($200/month) gives you:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unlimited messages</strong> (subject to abuse guardrails)</li>
                <li><strong>128K context window</strong> for Fast mode, <strong>196K</strong> for Thinking mode</li>
                <li><strong>Access to gpt-5-pro</strong></li>
                <li><strong>No o3-pro or o1-pro:</strong> Those remain Enterprise-only</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Consider Lookinglass if:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You're a light user:</strong> Why pay $20-$200/month when you can pay $2-$5/month?</li>
                <li><strong>You want complete model access:</strong> Free tier gives you no selection. Plus ($20/month) gives you some models. Pro ($200/month) still doesn't include everything. Lookinglass gives you all 21 models with no subscription required.</li>
                <li><strong>You need all pro models:</strong> Access o3-pro, o1-pro, AND gpt-5-pro without $200/month subscriptions or enterprise contracts</li>
                <li><strong>You need context control:</strong> Set from 500 tokens to 1M tokensâ€”you decide what the AI remembers</li>
                <li><strong>Quality consistency matters:</strong> Choose your model, get consistent results every timeâ€”no surprise downgrades</li>
                <li><strong>You need transparency:</strong> See your balance, costs, model, and tokens before every message</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Start with $1 free credit</strong> and compare the experience yourself.</p>
            
            <h2 id="models-features"><span role="img" aria-label="brain">ðŸ§ </span> AI Models & Features</h2>
            
            <h3 id="which-models">Which AI models are included?</h3>
            <p>Lookinglass provides access to <a href="/models">21 OpenAI models</a> including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ChatGPT Models (14 total):</strong> gpt-5 series (including gpt-5-pro), gpt-4o series (including chatgpt-4o-latest), gpt-4.1 series, gpt-4, and gpt-3.5</li>
                <li><strong>O-Series Reasoning (7 total):</strong> o1, o1-pro, o1-mini, o3, o3-pro, o3-mini, and o4-mini</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can switch between models mid-conversation based on your needs.</p>
            
            <h3 id="different-from-chatgpt">How is this different from ChatGPT?</h3>
            <p><strong>Transparency & Control:</strong> ChatGPT decides which model handles your request and automatically truncates conversation history to manage costs. With Lookinglass, YOU choose the model, YOU control context window size (500 tokens to 1M), and YOU see exactly what you're paying for.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Predictable Quality:</strong> ChatGPT routes to different models behind the scenes, so quality varies. Lookinglass gives you the exact model you selectedâ€”every time.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Fair Pricing:</strong> Subscriptions charge the same whether you send 10 messages or 1,000. With Lookinglass, light months cost less, heavy months cost more. Your bill matches your actual usage. <a href="https://chatgpt.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compare ChatGPT's plans</a>.</p>
            
            <h3 id="pro-model-access">What's special about pro model access?</h3>
            <p>Lookinglass gives you pay-per-use access to all three pro models: <strong>o3-pro</strong>, <strong>o1-pro</strong>, and <strong>gpt-5-pro</strong>.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>o3-pro and o1-pro</strong> are Enterprise-only at OpenAI (no public pricing, requires sales contact)</li>
                <li><strong>gpt-5-pro</strong> requires ChatGPT Pro ($200/month subscription)</li>
                <li><strong>Lookinglass</strong> is the only way to access all 3 on a pay-per-message basisâ€”no subscriptions, no enterprise contracts</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Use pro models for your most important tasks, pay only when you need them.</p>
            
            <h3 id="smart-savings">What is smart savings?</h3>
            <p>Smart savings saves you 50% on message costs if you're willing to wait a bit longer for responses. It's available on select models (gpt-5 series, o3, o4-mini) and perfect for non-urgent tasks where you want to optimize for cost over speed.</p>
            
           <h2 id="privacy-security"><span role="img" aria-label="lock">ðŸ”’</span> Privacy & Security</h2>
            
            <h3 id="data-privacy">Is my data private and secure?</h3>
            <p>Yes. We take privacy seriously â€” <a href="/privacy">read our full privacy policy</a>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No conversation storage on our servers:</strong> We don't store your messages or AI responses</li>
                <li><strong>Local-first storage:</strong> Your conversations stay on your device</li>
                <li><strong>Optional iCloud sync:</strong> If enabled, data syncs to YOUR personal iCloud accountâ€”we can't access it</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal metadata:</strong> Only billing and basic usage info is kept</li>
                <li><strong>Apple Sign-In:</strong> Secure authentication without exposing personal data</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="training-data">Is my data ever used to train AI models?</h3>
            <p>No, Lookinglass never stores your conversations or uses them for training. All prompts and responses stay on your device and are sent directly to OpenAI for processing via their API.</p>
            <p>However, OpenAI may use API data to improve their models unless exempted by policy. We do not currently have an enterprise-level data exemption, so while we don't retain or view your data, OpenAI might use it to train future models.</p>
            <p>For full transparency, see <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/your-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI's API Data Usage Policy</a>.</p>
                        
            <h3 id="data-collection">What information do you collect?</h3>
            <p>We collect minimal technical data to support billing, performance monitoring, and app functionality. We never store your prompts, responses, or conversation history â€” all of that stays on your device.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Model used and timestamp of each request</li>
                <li>Token counts (input and output) for accurate billing</li>
                <li>Selected settings (temperature, effort, context window, output limit)</li>
                <li>Query latency and delivery status (e.g., success, timeout)</li>
                <li>Basic account details (if you sign in with Apple)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data helps power features like cost tracking, usage history, and error handling; but we never store or access the content of your conversations.</p>
            
            <h2 id="app-features"><span role="img" aria-label="mobile phone">ðŸ“±</span> App Features</h2>
            
            <h3 id="permanent-memory">What is "permanent memory" and how does it work?</h3>
            <p>Permanent memory lets you tell the AI key information about yourself once, and it remembers across all conversations. For example: "I'm a Python developer working on iOS apps." This context gets included automatically, so you don't need to re-explain your background each time.</p>
            <p>Your memory is stored locally on your device and is sent with each message when enabled â€” but it's never stored on our servers or visible to us. You're always in control of what it remembers and when it's used. <a href="/#features">Learn more about memory and advanced controls</a>.</p>
            <h3 id="context-control">What conversation settings can I control?</h3>
            <p>Lookinglass gives you granular control over every aspect of your AI conversations. Here's what you can customize:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Smart Context (Smart Memory):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Toggle on/off:</strong> Enable or disable conversation history entirely</li>
                <li><strong>When enabled:</strong> Set from 500 tokens (minimum) up to your model's maximum context</li>
                <li><strong>Adjustable in 500-token increments:</strong> Fine-tune exactly how much conversation history the AI remembers</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Permanent Memory:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Toggle on/off:</strong> Enable or disable persistent context across all conversations</li>
                <li><strong>Custom text:</strong> Set background information about yourself that the AI remembers in every chat</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Response Settings:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maximum response length:</strong> Set output tokens from 100 (minimum) in 100-token increments to control how long responses can be</li>
                <li><strong>Live response streaming:</strong> Toggle whether responses appear letter-by-letter as they're generated or all at once</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>More context and longer responses cost more, but provide better continuity and more detailed answers. All conversation settings are accessible from the settings menu.</p>
            
            <h3 id="spending-protection">What is spending protection?</h3>
            <p>Spending protection alerts you before sending messages that exceed your chosen threshold. Enable spending alerts in settings, set your preferred threshold (like $0.01, $0.10, or any amount), and you'll get a warning before accidentally sending an expensive message.</p>
            
            <h3 id="voice-to-text">Can I use voice-to-text?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Lookinglass includes built-in voice-to-text, so you can speak your questions naturally instead of typing them.</p>
            
            <h2 id="getting-started"><span role="img" aria-label="rocket">ðŸš€</span> Getting Started</h2>
            
            <h3 id="free-download">Is the app free to download?</h3>
            <p>Yes, Lookinglass is completely free to download. You only pay for the messages you actually send.</p>
            
            <h3 id="create-account">Do I need to create an account?</h3>
            <p>No account is required to preview the app â€” guest mode lets you explore the interface and settings without signing in. However, guest mode does <strong>not</strong> allow you to send messages to AI models.</p>
            <p>To interact with models and use wallet features, you'll need to sign in with Apple. This enables:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sending messages to any of the 21 AI models</li>
                <li>Accessing your wallet and transaction history across devices</li>
                <li>Using permanent memory features</li>
                <li>Saving and managing conversation threads</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="minimum-wallet">What's the minimum amount I can add to my wallet?</h3>
            <p>Just $1! You can add amounts from $1 to $500. Many users start with $5 or $10 to try it out.</p>
            
            <h3 id="onboarding">Is there an onboarding tutorial?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Lookinglass includes an interactive <strong>AI Power User Guide</strong> that walks you through the app's key features when you first launch it. The tutorial covers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chat Interface:</strong> Learn how to use the main conversation view</li>
                <li><strong>Accessing Threads:</strong> Organize and navigate between different conversations</li>
                <li><strong>Choosing AI Models:</strong> Browse and select from recommended models based on your needs</li>
                <li><strong>Voice-to-Text:</strong> Use the microphone button for hands-free input</li>
                <li><strong>Sending Messages:</strong> Tap to send and see real-time cost estimates in the cost bar</li>
                <li><strong>Model Types:</strong> Understand different model categories (nano, mini, pro) and how reasoning models use reasoning tokens</li>
                <li><strong>Conversation Settings:</strong> Toggle smart context and permanent memory on/off, control memory size (tokens), set maximum response length (tokens), choose billing plan, adjust creativity, response detail level, and AI power level</li>
                <li><strong>Help Icons:</strong> Discover the question mark icons throughout the app for contextual explanations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can replay the tutorial anytime from <strong>Settings â†’ Your AI Power User Guide</strong> if you need a refresher.</p>

            <h3 id="languages">What languages are supported?</h3>
            <p>Lookinglass is available in <strong>5 languages</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>English</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Spanish (EspaÃ±ol)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>French (FranÃ§ais)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Portuguese (PortuguÃªs)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Italian (Italiano)</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The app automatically detects your device language and displays in the appropriate localization if it's one of the supported languages. All UI elements, settings, and help text are fully translated â€” only your conversations with AI models use the language you choose to type or speak in.</p>
            
            <h2 id="technical"><span role="img" aria-label="tools">ðŸ› </span> Technical</h2>
            
            <h3 id="devices-supported">Which devices are supported?</h3>
            <p>Lookinglass works on iPhone and iPad running iOS 17 or later. It's designed exclusively for Apple devices.</p>
            
            <h3 id="offline">Does it work offline?</h3>
            <p>No, Lookinglass requires an internet connection to communicate with AI models. However, your conversation history and settings are stored locally when possible.</p>
            
            <h3 id="export-history">Can I export my conversation history?</h3>
            <p>Yes! You can <strong>export entire chat threads</strong> in multiple formats including <strong>plaintext, JSON, or markdown documents</strong>. You can also copy and paste individual messages from your conversations. Additionally, you can export your <strong>transaction history and usage data</strong> as CSV files anytime.</p>
            
            <h3 id="audit-transactions">What does the audit feature track?</h3>
            <p>Lookinglass includes a comprehensive audit system that gives you complete transparency into every transaction. The audit feature tracks two types of activities:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Wallet Top-Ups:</strong> See when you added funds to your account</p>
            
            <p><strong>API Usage (Message Costs):</strong> Each message you send is logged with detailed information including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Date & Time:</strong> Exact timestamp of when the request was made</li>
                <li><strong>Model Used:</strong> Which AI model processed your message</li>
                <li><strong>Status:</strong> Success, error, or failure indicator</li>
                <li><strong>Request & Audit IDs:</strong> Unique identifiers for tracking and support</li>
                <li><strong>Token Usage:</strong> Input tokens, output tokens, and cached input tokens (when applicable)</li>
                <li><strong>OpenAI Rates Snapshot:</strong> The exact per-token pricing rates at the time of your request</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Breakdown:</strong> Subtotal for OpenAI charges, Lookinglass fee, and total amount charged</li>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type and device ID for multi-device tracking</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This level of detail ensures you always know exactly what you paid for, which device made the request, and can verify charges against OpenAI's published rates. You can export your entire audit history as a CSV file for your records or expense tracking.</p>
