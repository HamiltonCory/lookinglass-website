        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "We believe in subscription fatigue relief. Instead of paying $20-200/month whether you use AI or not, you only pay for the messages you actually send. Top up your wallet with amounts from $1-500, use what you need, keep the rest. Many users spend less than $5/month this way."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "You probably shouldn't—if free ChatGPT's limitations work for you.\n\nFree tier limitations:\n- Rate limits that OpenAI doesn't publish or explain\n- \"Try again later\" messages that cut you off mid-work\n- Context truncation: Your conversation history gets shortened automatically—you don't control it\n- Automatic model switching: Downgraded to lower-quality models without notification\n- No visibility: Can't see which model you're using or how much capacity remains\n- \"At capacity\" errors: Access denied during peak hours\n\nConsider Lookinglass if:\n- You need predictability: No surprise limits or \"try again later\"\n- Context matters: Control how much conversation history the AI remembers (500 tokens to 1M)\n- Quality consistency matters: Choose your model, get consistent results every time\n- You need transparency: See your balance, costs, model, and tokens—always\n- You need pro models: Access o3-pro, o1-pro, gpt-5-pro without $200/month subscriptions\n\nStart with $1 free credit and compare the experience yourself."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Transparency & Control: ChatGPT decides which model handles your request and automatically truncates conversation history to manage costs. With Lookinglass, YOU choose the model, YOU control context window size (500 tokens to 1M), and YOU see exactly what you're paying for.\n\nPredictable Quality: ChatGPT routes to different models behind the scenes, so quality varies. Lookinglass gives you the exact model you selected—every time.\n\nFair Pricing: Subscriptions charge the same whether you send 10 messages or 1,000. With Lookinglass, light months cost less, heavy months cost more. Your bill matches your actual usage."

You have full control over smart memory (context window):\n\nToggle on/off: Enable or disable conversation history entirely\nWhen enabled: Set from 500 tokens (minimum) up to your model's maximum context\nAdjustable in 500-token increments: Fine-tune exactly how much history the AI remembers\nResponse length control: Set output tokens from 100 (minimum) in 100-token increments\n\nMore context costs more but provides better continuity."
