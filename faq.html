            <h2>ðŸ’° Pricing & Billing</h2>
            
            <h3>Why pay-as-you-go instead of subscriptions?</h3>
            <p>We believe in subscription fatigue relief. Instead of paying $20-200/month whether you use AI or not, you only pay for the messages you actually send. Top up your wallet with amounts from $1-500, use what you need, keep the rest. Many users spend less than $5/month this way.</p>
            
            <h3>How much does it typically cost to use?</h3>
            <p>Costs vary by model and message length, but here are some examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple questions (GPT-4o-mini):</strong> $0.001-0.01 per message</li>
                <li><strong>Complex reasoning (o3):</strong> $0.01-0.10 per message</li>
                <li><strong>Premium reasoning (o3-pro):</strong> $0.05-0.50 for complex tasks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The app shows you the exact cost before sending each message, so there are never surprises.</p>
            
            <h3>What happens to unused wallet funds?</h3>
            <p>Your wallet funds never expire and are non-refundable. You can use them whenever you want, even months later. There are no monthly fees or account maintenance charges.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I get a refund on wallet funds?</h3>
            <p>Wallet funds are non-refundable once added, as stated in our terms. However, they never expire, so you can use them whenever you're ready.</p>
            
            <h2>ðŸ§  AI Models & Features</h2>
            
            <h3>Which AI models are included?</h3>
            <p>Lookinglass provides access to 20 OpenAI models including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GPT Models:</strong> GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and variants</li>
                <li><strong>O-Series (Reasoning):</strong> o1, o1-mini, o3, o3-mini, o4-mini, o3-pro</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can switch between models mid-conversation based on your needs.</p>
            
            <h3>How is this different from ChatGPT?</h3>
            <p>Key differences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Pay-per-use vs $20-200/month subscriptions</li>
                <li><strong>Model Choice:</strong> You pick the exact model; ChatGPT routes automatically</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> See costs upfront; ChatGPT pricing is hidden</li>
                <li><strong>Control:</strong> Adjust memory, context windows; ChatGPT is fixed</li>
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> Get o3-pro without $200/month Pro subscription</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What's special about o3-pro access?</h3>
            <p>o3-pro is OpenAI's most advanced reasoning model, normally exclusive to ChatGPT Pro subscribers ($200/month). Lookinglass gives you access on a pay-per-message basis, so you can use it for important tasks without the monthly commitment.</p>
            
            <h3>What does "Flex pricing" mean?</h3>
            <p>Flex pricing saves you 50% on message costs if you're willing to wait a bit longer for responses. It's perfect for non-urgent tasks where you want to optimize for cost over speed.</p>
            
            <h2>ðŸ”’ Privacy & Security</h2>
            
            <h3>Is my data private and secure?</h3>
            <p>Yes. We take privacy seriously:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No conversation storage:</strong> We don't store your messages or AI responses</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal metadata:</strong> Only billing and basic usage info is kept</li>
                <li><strong>Apple Sign-In:</strong> Secure authentication without exposing personal data</li>
                <li><strong>Guest mode:</strong> Use completely anonymously if preferred</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What information do you collect?</h3>
            <p>We collect minimal data for billing and app functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which model you used and when</li>
                <li>Token counts for accurate billing</li>
                <li>Basic account info (if you sign in with Apple)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We never see your actual conversations or prompts.</p>
            
            <h2>ðŸ“± App Features</h2>
            
            <h3>What is "permanent memory" and how does it work?</h3>
            <p>Permanent memory lets you tell the AI key information about yourself once, and it remembers across all conversations. For example: "I'm a Python developer working on iOS apps." This context gets included automatically, so you don't need to re-explain your background each time.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I control how much the AI remembers?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely! You control the context window:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Short memory:</strong> Remember just the last few messages (cheaper, faster)</li>
                <li><strong>Long memory:</strong> Remember the entire conversation history</li>
                <li><strong>Custom:</strong> Set exactly how many messages to remember</li>
            </ul>
            <p>More context costs more but provides better continuity.</p>
            
            <h3>What is the cost guard feature?</h3>
            <p>Cost guard alerts you before sending messages that exceed your chosen threshold. Set it to $0.01, $0.10, or any amount, and you'll get a warning before accidentally sending an expensive message.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I use voice input?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Lookinglass includes built-in voice-to-text, so you can speak your questions naturally instead of typing them.</p>
            
            <h2>ðŸš€ Getting Started</h2>
