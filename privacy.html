            <h2 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h2>
            
            <h3>Account Information</h3>
            <p>When you sign in with Apple ID, we receive limited information from Apple, which may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your name (if you choose to share it)</li>
                <li>Your email address (if you choose to share it)</li>

            <h3>Usage Metadata</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Which AI model you selected for each request</li>
                <li>Timestamps of when requests were made</li>
                <li>Cost estimates and actual costs for each request</li>

                <li>Purchase amounts and timestamps</li>
                <li>Usage charges against your wallet balance</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="what-we-dont-collect">What We Don't Collect</h2>
            
            <p><strong>We do not store, log, or have access to:</strong></p>

            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="how-we-use-information">How We Use Your Information</h2>
            
            <p>We use the collected information solely for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service Operation:</strong> Facilitating API requests to OpenAI</li>
                <li><strong>Billing:</strong> Calculating costs and managing your wallet balance</li>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> Providing customer assistance when requested</li>
                <li><strong>App Improvement:</strong> Understanding usage patterns to improve the app (in aggregate only)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="data-sharing">Data Sharing</h2>
            
            <h3>OpenAI</h3>
            <p>Your prompts and conversations are sent directly to OpenAI's API. Please review <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a> for information about how they handle your data.</p>
            
            <h3>Apple</h3>
            <p>Payment processing and account authentication are handled by Apple. Your financial transactions are subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
            
            <h3>No Other Sharing</h3>
            <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with any other third parties for marketing or other purposes.</p>
            
            <h2 id="icloud-sync">iCloud Sync & Your Data</h2>
            
            <h3>Optional iCloud Integration</h3>
            <p>Lookinglass offers optional iCloud sync to keep your conversations, settings, and preferences synchronized across all your iOS devices. This feature is entirely optional and controlled by you.</p>
            
            <h3>How iCloud Sync Works</h3>
            <p>When you enable iCloud sync:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your data stays in YOUR iCloud account:</strong> All synced data is stored in your personal iCloud storage, not on our servers</li>
                <li><strong>We cannot access it:</strong> Because the data lives in your iCloud account, Lookinglass has no access to view, read, or retrieve your synced conversations</li>
                <li><strong>Apple manages the encryption:</strong> Your iCloud data is encrypted and protected by Apple's security infrastructure</li>
                <li><strong>What syncs:</strong> Conversations, chat threads, settings, preferences, and permanent memory (when enabled)</li>
                <li><strong>Your control:</strong> You can disable iCloud sync at any time, and your data will remain local to your device</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This means your conversations are truly privateâ€”even from us. We've designed Lookinglass so that your actual chat content never touches our servers, whether stored locally on your device or synced via your personal iCloud account.</p>
            
            <h2 id="data-security">Data Security</h2>
            
            <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All data transmission to OpenAI is encrypted using industry-standard protocols</li>
                <li>Local storage on your device uses AES-256 encryption</li>
                <li>Minimal data retention practices</li>
                <li>Regular security assessments</li>
                <li>Access controls limiting who can view account information</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="data-retention">Data Retention</h2>
            
            <p>We retain your data for the following periods:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Until you delete your account</li>
                <li><strong>Transaction History:</strong> 7 years for tax and accounting purposes</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Metadata:</strong> 2 years for service improvement and support</li>
                <li><strong>Conversations:</strong> We don't store these at all</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="your-rights">Your Rights</h2>
            
            <p>You have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
