            <h2><span role="img" aria-label="money bag">ðŸ’°</span> Pricing & Billing</h2>
            
            <h3>Why pay-as-you-go instead of subscriptions?</h3>
            <p>We built Lookinglass to fight subscription fatigue. Instead of paying $20â€“$200/month whether you use AI or not, you only pay for the messages you send.</p>

            <h3>How much does it typically cost to use?</h3>
            <p>Costs vary by model and message length, but here are some examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple questions (GPT-4o-mini):</strong> $0.001-0.01 per message</li>
                <li><strong>Complex reasoning (o3):</strong> $0.01-0.10 per message</li>
                <li><strong>Premium reasoning (o3-pro):</strong> $0.05-0.50 for complex tasks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The app shows you the exact cost before sending each message, so there are never surprises.</p>
            
            <h3>What happens to my wallet funds?</h3>
            <p>Wallet funds are <strong>non-refundable</strong> but <strong>never expire</strong>. You can use them anytime, with no monthly fees or account maintenance charges. Whether you top up $1 or $100, the balance stays available until you need it.</p>
            
            <h2><span role="img" aria-label="brain">ðŸ§ </span> AI Models & Features</h2>
            
            <h3>Which AI models are included?</h3>
            <p>Lookinglass provides access to 20 OpenAI models including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>GPT Models:</strong> GPT-5, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and variants</li>
                <li><strong>O-Series (Reasoning):</strong> o1, o1-mini, o3, o3-mini, o4-mini, o3-pro</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can switch between models mid-conversation based on your needs.</p>
            
            <h3>How is this different from ChatGPT?</h3>
            <p>Key differences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Pay-per-use vs $20-200/month subscriptions</li>
                <li><strong>Model Choice:</strong> You pick the exact model; ChatGPT routes automatically</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> See costs upfront; ChatGPT pricing is hidden</li>
                <li><strong>Control:</strong> Adjust memory, context windows; ChatGPT is fixed</li>
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> Get o3-pro without $200/month Pro subscription</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What's special about o3-pro access?</h3>
            <p>o3-pro is OpenAI's most advanced reasoning model, normally exclusive to ChatGPT Pro subscribers ($200/month). Lookinglass gives you access on a pay-per-message basis, so you can use it for important tasks without the monthly commitment.</p>
            
            <h3>What does "Flex pricing" mean?</h3>
            <p>Flex pricing saves you 50% on message costs if you're willing to wait a bit longer for responses. It's perfect for non-urgent tasks where you want to optimize for cost over speed.</p>
            
           <h2><span role="img" aria-label="lock">ðŸ”’</span> Privacy & Security</h2>
            
            <h3>Is my data private and secure?</h3>
            <p>Yes. We take privacy seriously:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No conversation storage:</strong> We don't store your messages or AI responses</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal metadata:</strong> Only billing and basic usage info is kept</li>
                <li><strong>Apple Sign-In:</strong> Secure authentication without exposing personal data</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What information do you collect?</h3>
            <p>We collect minimal technical data to support billing, performance monitoring, and app functionality. We never store your prompts, responses, or conversation history â€” all of that stays on your device.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Model used and timestamp of each request</li>
                <li>Token counts (input and output) for accurate billing</li>
                <li>Selected settings (temperature, effort, context window, output limit)</li>
                <li>Query latency and delivery status (e.g., success, timeout)</li>
                <li>Basic account details (if you sign in with Apple)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data helps power features like cost tracking, usage history, and error handling; but we never store or access the content of your conversations.</p>
            
            <h2><span role="img" aria-label="mobile phone">ðŸ“±</span> App Features</h2>
            
            <h3>What is "permanent memory" and how does it work?</h3>
            <p>Permanent memory lets you tell the AI key information about yourself once, and it remembers across all conversations. For example: "I'm a Python developer working on iOS apps." This context gets included automatically, so you donâ€™t need to re-explain your background each time.</p>
            <p>Your memory is stored locally on your device and is sent with each message when enabled â€” but itâ€™s never stored on our servers or visible to us. Youâ€™re always in control of what it remembers and when itâ€™s used.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I control how much the AI remembers?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely! You control the context window:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Short memory:</strong> Remember just the last few messages (cheaper, faster)</li>
                <li><strong>Long memory:</strong> Remember the entire conversation history</li>
                <li><strong>Custom:</strong> Set exactly how many messages to remember</li>
            </ul>
            <p>More context costs more but provides better continuity.</p>
            
            <h3>What is the cost guard feature?</h3>
            <p>Cost guard alerts you before sending messages that exceed your chosen threshold. Set it to $0.01, $0.10, or any amount, and you'll get a warning before accidentally sending an expensive message.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I use voice-to-text?</h3>
            <p>Yes! Lookinglass includes built-in voice-to-text, so you can speak your questions naturally instead of typing them.</p>
            
            <h2><span role="img" aria-label="rocket">ðŸš€</span> Getting Started</h2>
            
            <h3>Is the app free to download?</h3>
            <p>Yes, Lookinglass is completely free to download. You only pay for the messages you actually send.</p>
            
            <h3>Do I need to create an account?</h3>
            <p>No account is required to preview the app â€” guest mode lets you explore the interface and settings without signing in. However, guest mode does <strong>not</strong> allow you to send messages to AI models.</p>
            <p>To interact with models and use wallet features, you'll need to sign in with Apple. This enables:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sending messages to any of the 20 AI models</li>
                <li>Accessing your wallet and transaction history across devices</li>
                <li>Using permanent memory features</li>
                <li>Saving and managing conversation threads</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What's the minimum amount I can add to my wallet?</h3>
            <p>Just $1! You can add amounts from $1 to $500. Many users start with $5 or $10 to try it out.</p>
            
            <h3>Is there an onboarding tutorial?</h3>
            <p>Yes! The app includes an interactive tutorial that explains all the features. You can access it anytime from Settings if you want a refresher.</p>
            
            <h2><span role="img" aria-label="tools">ðŸ› </span> Technical</h2>
            
            <h3>Which devices are supported?</h3>
            <p>Lookinglass works on iPhone and iPad running iOS 15 or later. It's designed exclusively for Apple devices.</p>
            
            <h3>Does it work offline?</h3>
            <p>No, Lookinglass requires an internet connection to communicate with AI models. However, your conversation history and settings are stored locally when possible.</p>
            
            <h3>Can I export my conversation history?</h3>
            <p>Right now, you can <strong>copy and paste individual messages</strong> from your conversations, but there's no built-in export feature for full chat threads yet. However, you can export your <strong>transaction history and usage data</strong> as CSV files anytime.</p>
